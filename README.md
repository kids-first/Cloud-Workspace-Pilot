___About the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE):___ The NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) aims to enable broad use of Common Fund data to accelerate discovery. Common Fund programs generate a wide range of diverse and valuable data sets and knowledge designed to be used by the research community.  For more information about the CFDE, visit https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem. 


___About the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (Kids First DRC):___ 
The Kids First DRC is a collaborative, pediatric research effort with the goal of understanding the genetic causes and links between childhood cancer and structural birth defects. As part of the NIH Common Fund’s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, the Kids First DRC is charged with:
- Developing data-driven platforms that integrate large amounts of genomic and clinical data from different disease types.
- Empowering the collaborative discovery, engagement, and necessary partnerships across disease communities that are crucial for progress in our biological understanding of diseases.
- Enabling rapid translation to personalized treatments for patients diagnosed with childhood cancer or structural birth defects.
- Accelerating discovery of genetic causes and shared biologic pathways within and across these conditions.
